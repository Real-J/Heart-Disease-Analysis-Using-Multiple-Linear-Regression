Smoking has been identified as the major cause of
cardiovascular disease, ever since this fact was scientifically
proven numerous activities have been pointed out to be lifesaving
as to avoid cardiovascular disease for men and women
smokers alike. In this paper, we have explained why cycling is a
better way to avoid cardiovascular disease. To prove our
hypothesis, we surveyed 500 smokers and recorded their
healthcare data. The paper continues by constructing a
mathematical relationship using multiple linear regression and
statistically proves our hypothesis thus effectively making it a
theory.
